    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of Beef Sirloin</li>
        <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 Knorr beef cube</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. of butter</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. of Canola oil</li>
        <h3>Marinade ingredients</h3>
        <li>2 tbsp. of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. of oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp. of garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. of cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Marinating the beef sirloiin</h4><p>For this, you just need to put your beef sirloin, soy sauce, oyster sauce, ground black pepper, garlic powder and cornstarch in a container. Now mix these together, and make sure that the beef is nicely covered by the marinade. Wait for 10 minutes to let the flavor soak into the meat.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Creating toasted garlic</h4><p>While waiting, we can go ahead, and heat up some oil in our pan. And then put the minced garlic inside for cooking in low heat. Making sure that this does not get burnt, you can keep cooking until you have a golden brown color for the garlic. Then use a kitchen strainer to filter your garlic with a container below to catch the oil. Set this aside, along with the oil that we have gathered as we will use this later.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Cooking up the beef</h4><p> Once the marinating time is up, it’s off to frying! Pour your garlic oil in the pan we used earlier, and let this get hot. Then put your marinated beef inside, and fry this until the beef is brown. Take the beef out of the pan for now. And then add butter to the pan, and just melt this. Put half of your Knorr beef cube. Now we have to place the beef back inside, and stir-fry everything for a good 30 seconds. </p></li>
        <li><h4>Making the sauce</h4><p>Incorporate your water now so we can create the sauce. Just wait for this to boil, and then stir everything once boiling has begun. You can keep cooking until you get to see the consistency you would like for your sauce. After that, you can top the dish off with some of your toasted garlic from earlier.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Serve and Eat!</h4><p>And voila! You’ve got yourself some tasty Garlic Pepper Beef. Feel free to transfer this to a serving bowl of choice.</p></li>
